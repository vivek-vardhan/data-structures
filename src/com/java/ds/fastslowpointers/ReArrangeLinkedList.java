     nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order.

     Output: 2 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> null  2nd half is alternating and reverse

     1. We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the middle node of the LinkedList.
     2. Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList.
     3. Finally, weâ€™ll iterate through the first half and the reversed second half to produce a LinkedList in the required order.
